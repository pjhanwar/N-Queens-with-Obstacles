# N-Queens-with-Obstacles

The code is an implementation of traditional n-queens problem with obstacles using 3 algorithms:<br>
Depth First Search<br>
Breadth First Search &<br>
Simiulated Annealing<br>

If an obstacle is present in a row of the borad, the queen can be placed at either side of the obstacle without attacking each other.
